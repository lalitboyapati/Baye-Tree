# ðŸŒ³ðŸ§  Baye-Tree: Integrating Naive Bayes into Decision Trees

This hybrid classification model combines the interpretability of **Decision Trees** with the probabilistic efficiency of **Naive Bayes**. By embedding Naive Bayes at intermediate and leaf nodes of a decision tree, the Baye-Tree aims to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization on structured data.

## ðŸ§  Methodology
The Baye-Tree builds a traditional decision tree and integrates Naive Bayes classifiers at specific nodes. Based on a confidence threshold, the model decides whether to split further or predict using Naive Bayes. This provides a flexible framework that adapts to data complexity and feature independence.
